```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes. However, if the `to-purple-500` class is missing or mistyped, the gradient will not render properly. The error will likely not be directly apparent in the browser's developer console.
