```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
Ensure that `to-purple-500` is correctly spelled and present. Double-check your Tailwind configuration to ensure the required classes are available. If you are using a preprocessor like `PostCSS` and `Autoprefixer`, make sure that it is correctly configured and that it is processing your styles properly. Using your browser's developer tools to inspect the element's computed styles can help identify if the gradient is not being applied.
