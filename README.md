# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in Tailwind CSS related to gradient utilities.  The issue stems from a missing or mistyped class name in the gradient definition, leading to unexpected rendering behavior.  The error may not always manifest as a clear console error, making it harder to debug.

## The Problem
The code uses Tailwind's gradient classes to create a background gradient. A simple typo or omission can cause the gradient to fail silently.

## Solution
Carefully review your Tailwind classes to ensure that all class names are spelled correctly and are included in the code. Tools like linters can help prevent these types of errors.
